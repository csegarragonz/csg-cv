\section{Short Bio}
\begin{tabular}{p{\dimexpr1.5cm+15.5cm}}
    I am a MSc student in advanced mathematics at the School of Mathematics from the Technical University of Catalonia, in Barcelona, Spain.
    I am focusing on graph theory, combinatorics and cryptography.
    Further, I also attend courses on distributed systems, concurrency, and networking from the Master in Research in Informatics.
    In fall 2020, I will start a PhD in Computer Science at the Imperial College in London under the supervision of Prof. Peter Pietzuch.
    At the moment, I collaborate with the Computer Architecture Department in my home university and with the Complex Systems Group of the Universit\'e de Neuch\^atel (Switzerland).
    My main research interests are systems and security, with a strong mathematical foundation.

    We emulated arbitrary topologies basing on their end-to-end properties: bandwidth, jitter, latency, and packet loss. 
    Dynamic link behaviours are also emulated.
    To do so, we used traffic control functionalities available in the Linux Kernel. 
    For the emulated applications we relied on Docker containers and orchestrators such as Swarm and Kubernetes.
    In parallel, we worked on benchmarking of Trusted Execution Environments and applications leveraging them.

         As a research collaborator with the DAC group, I am implementing live migration for running container deployments, both standalone and in a cluster. 
         We are using checkpoint-restore techniques, relying on Checkpoint/Restore in Userspace (CRIU).
         The project involves dealing with the large CRIU codebase written in \textsc{C} and implementing the right wrappers and handlers (\textsc{C} and \textsc{Go}) to make the live migration transparent to the end user.
         Even though this is an on-going project, it is \href{https://github.com/live-containers}{available} on Github.

         As a research collaborator with the Complex Systems Group at the University of Neuch\^atel, I worked in a decentralized emulator for distributed applications.
         In collaboration with the Distributed Systems Group at the INESC-ID in Lisbon, Portugal, I was responsible for the benchmarking of the project.
         In particular, I worked with applications generating different sorts of workloads (\textit{e.g} \textsc{iPerf3} and \textsc{wrk2}) along different network topologies using different TCP congestion algorithms.
         I also replicated the results in bare metal, and in other emulation and simulation engines.
         Moving forward, we will work on implementing different bandwidth sharing models to improve the emulation accuracy.
         The architecture and the benchmarking have been accepted to EuroSys 2020, once the camera ready version is made public, code will be open-sourced.
