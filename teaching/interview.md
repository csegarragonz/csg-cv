# Task

Talk us through a lesson plan during the interview.
+ Subject and level is absolutely fine
+ Looking for:
  - Clear aims
  - Objective
  - Structure

## The Pigeonhole Principle: Definition & Some Application

+ The aim of the lesson is to introduce de pigeonhole principle, a counting
  argument in combinatorics and discrete mathematics. In particular after the
  lessen a student should:
  - Practice known concepts of: proof by contradiction and sequences
  - Have understood the reasoning behind the principle.
  - Followed the formal proofs (don't need to remember it)
  - KEY: Student must understand when this principle is useful and when it could
    be applied
+ It is targeted to late high-school, early undergraduate students, or just
  pupils with a strong interest in math.
+ The structure of the session would depend on:
  - The number of pupils
  - Online or in-person setting

### Lesson Structure

+ **General introduction:**
  - General introduction and historical context
  - Placing math in its historical context and the little idiosincracies of
    the stories may make it more accessible and easy to understand.
+ **Statement of the principle:**
  - Simple definition to get the concept down
  - Formal definition (because math) -> formality level would depend on the
    students maturity
+ **Simple Examples**
  - Two easy to understand examples of the application of the principle
+ **Formal proof**
  - Pen and paper together if in-person
  - Digital whiteboard if online. Would do from scracth
+ **Complex examples of application:**
  - Direct application of principle
  - More advanced corollary
