\section{Short Bio}
\begin{tabular}{p{\pageWidth}}
    I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at Imperial College.
    I received a MSc in advanced mathematics, a BSc in mathematics, and a BSc
    in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia.

    Originally from Barcelona in Spain, I have worked and lived in
    France, Switzerland, and now the UK.
    I can speak spanish, english, and catalan perfectly, french very fluently,
    and german modestly.

    Currently, I am a teaching assistant at the Department of Computing of Imperial.
    I specialise in discrete mathematics and algorithms.
    I am willing to teach mathematics at any curricular level, computer
    science and programming both curricular and extra-curricular.

    I can teach a broad range of curricular levels, and a broad range of
    abilities: from high-school students struggling to keep up with math coursework
    to professionals willing to take programming up.
\end{tabular}

\section{Tutoring Experience}
\begin{tabular}{p{\pageWidth}}
    I am an experienced private tutor with various agencies in London.
    I have tutored all GCSE sciences, GCSE mathematics, and GCSE's computer science.
    I also tutor undergraduate students, both as a private tutor and in my role as teaching assistant at Imperial, in computer science and mathematics courses.
    References from previous and current students can be provided upon request.
